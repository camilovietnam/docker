# Laravel directory

Put all the Laravel files inside this directory. If you want to use an 
external directory, feel free to change the ENV variable `LARAVEL_DIR` in
the `.env` file.

The `mysql` folder will contain the database information so that you can 
reuse it through different container runs.
